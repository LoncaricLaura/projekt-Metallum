					What is a cookie?
				</h1>
				<p class="fs-base mt-xs">
					A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification
					number that is transferred (through your browser) from a website to
					the hard drive of your computer's hard drive or mobile device when you
					visit the website. It enables the website to remember your actions and
					preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display
					preferences) over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep
					re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one
					page to another. These files are then used by websites to identify
					when you revisit that website.
				</p>

				<p class="fs-base mt-xs">
					Cookies are mostly used to allow websites to function, or to function
					more efficiently, as well as to provide information to website owners.
					Cookies can also be used to establish anonymised statistics about the
					browsing experience on our sites. The information does not usually
					directly identify you, but it can give you a more personalised web
					experience. The law states that we can store cookies on your device if
					they are strictly necessary for the operation of this site. For all
					other types of cookies we need your permission.
				</p>

				<h2 class="fs-md mt-sm">
					Use of cookies
				</h2>
				<p class="fs-base mt-xs">
					{{ appName }} uses cookies for many different reasons. We may collect
					information about your computer, including your IP address, operating
					system and browser type, for system administration purposes. This is
					statistical data about your browsing actions and patterns and does not
					identify you as an individual. We use cookies to personalise content
					and ads, to provide social media features and to analyse our traffic.
					We also share information about your use of our site with our social
					media, advertising and analytics partners who may combine it with
					other information that you’ve provided to them or that they’ve
					collected from your use of their services. You consent to our cookies
					if you continue to use our website. The website uses cookies to
					distinguish you from other users of the website. This helps us to
					deliver a better and more personalised service to you when you browse
					the website and also allows us to improve the website.
				</p>

				<h2 class="fs-md mt-sm">
					Essential and non-essential cookies
				</h2>
				<p class="fs-base mt-xs">
					Cookies can be classified as either 'essential' or 'non-essential'.
				</p>

				<p class="fs-base">
					<b>Essential cookies</b> are cookies that are either: <br>-used
					solely to carry out or facilitate the transmission of communications
					over a network; or <br>-strictly necessary to provide an online
					service (e.g. our website or a service on our website) which you have
					requested.
				</p>

				<p class="fs-base">
					<b>Non-essential cookies</b> are any cookies that do not fall within
					the definition of essential cookies, such as cookies used to analyse
					your behaviour on a website ('performance' cookies) or cookies used to
					display advertisements to you ('targeting' cookies).
				</p>

				<h2 class="fs-md mt-sm">
					Session and persistent cookies
				</h2>
				<p class="fs-base mt-xs">
					Cookies can be classified as either 'session' or 'persistent',
					depending on how long they last after they are placed on your browser.
				</p>

				<p class="fs-base">
					<b>Session cookies:</b> session cookies last for as long as you keep
					your browser open. They expire when you close your browser.
				</p>

				<p class="fs-base">
					<b>Persistent cookies:</b> persistent cookies expire at a fixed point
					in time or if you manually delete them from your browser, whichever
					occurs first.
				</p>

				<h2 class="fs-md mt-sm">
					First and third party cookies
				</h2>
				<p class="fs-base mt-xs">
					Cookies can be classified as 'first party' or 'third party'.
				</p>

				<p class="fs-base">
					<b>First party cookies:</b> these are cookies placed on your device by
					our website domain.
				</p>

				<p class="fs-base">
					<b>Third party cookies:</b> these are cookies placed on your device by
					third party website domains.

					Different types of web cookies
				</h2>

				<h2 class="fs-md mt-xs">
					Necessary Cookies
				</h2>

				<p class="fs-base mt-xs">
					These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be
					switched off in our systems. You can set your browser to block or
					alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not
					then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable
					information.
				</p>

				<h2 class="fs-md mt-sm">
					Functional Cookies
				</h2>
				<p class="fs-base mt-xs">
					These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and
					personalisation. They may be set by us or by third party providers
					whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these
					cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly.
				</p>

				<h2 class="fs-md mt-sm">
					Performance (or Analytical) Cookies
				</h2>
				<p class="fs-base mt-xs">
					These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can
					measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know
					which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move
					around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated
					and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies we will not
					know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor
					its performance.
				</p>

				<h2 class="fs-md mt-sm">
					Targeting (or Advertising) Cookies
				</h2>
				<p class="fs-base mt-xs">
					These cookies may be set through our site by our carefully selected
					and monitored advertising partners (third parties). They may be used
					by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you
					relevant adverts on other sites. They do not store directly personal
					information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and
					internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will
					experience less targeted advertising.

					How Can I Stop The Cookies?
